# weaver
A simple library for simple website development, designed primarily for use with cPanel.
Your CSS, HTML, and both your server-side and client-side JavaScript can all be written in one place as just JavaScript!
Using weaver makes it incredibly simple to see how the pieces of your application interact,
and is primarily intended for allowing the rapid deployment of prototypes for interactive browser software,
but is also fantastic for writing static  dynamically generated sites.

### Notice

This project has permanently moved to my website, [Modula](https://modula.dev/weaver) 

### The TLDR of How to Use It
1. Download the [weaver source](https://modula.dev/weaver.js) to your project directory.
2. Write an `app.js` file
4. Create a cPanel node application and replace the auto-generated `app.js` with the one you wrote
5. Clone Weaver into the cPanel application's directory 
6. Refresh the node application you created
