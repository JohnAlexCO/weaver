# Documentation Source

This directory contains the source code used to serve the [Documentation and Tutorials](https://johnalex.co/weaver) website
The website adds
[showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) as a dependency,
and uses a [timestamping function](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-format-date-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss) based on Borislav Hadzhiev's blogpost.
Most of the documentation site is written in Markdown while some components are written in JavaScript.
As far as userland goes, this website is statically served; no JavaScript is served to the user by the documentation site.
*The source code herein is provided under the same license as the repository it is part of*.
